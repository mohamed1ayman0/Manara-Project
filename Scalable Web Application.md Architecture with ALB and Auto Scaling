# Scalable Web Application Architecture with ALB and Auto Scaling

## Overview
This architecture implements a highly available, scalable web application using Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). The design follows AWS best practices for security, scalability, and cost optimization.

## Architecture Diagram
The architecture includes the following components:


## Key Components

### 1. VPC and Network Infrastructure
- **VPC**: A dedicated VPC with CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16
- **Subnets**:
  - Public Subnets (10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24) in two Availability Zones
  - Private Subnets for EC2 instances (10.0.3.0/24, 10.0.4.0/24) in two Availability Zones
  - Private Subnets for RDS (10.0.5.0/24, 10.0.6.0/24) in two Availability Zones
- **Internet Gateway**: Attached to the VPC for public internet access
- **NAT Gateways**: Deployed in each public subnet to allow outbound internet access for resources in private subnets
- **Route Tables**: Configured to direct traffic appropriately between subnets

### 2. Compute Layer
- **EC2 Instances**: Deployed in private subnets across multiple Availability Zones
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**:
  - Min/Max/Desired capacity configured based on expected load
  - Scaling policies based on CPU utilization and network traffic
  - Health checks to ensure instance availability
- **Launch Template/Configuration**:
  - Amazon Linux 2 AMI with pre-installed web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
  - User data script to configure the web application on startup
  - Instance type optimized for web workloads (e.g., t3.medium)

### 3. Load Balancing
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
  - Deployed across multiple Availability Zones
  - Listener on port 80 (HTTP) and/or 443 (HTTPS)
  - Target group pointing to the Auto Scaling Group
  - Health checks to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy instances
  - Security group allowing inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic

### 4. Database Layer (Optional)
- **Amazon RDS**:
  - Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
  - MySQL or PostgreSQL engine
  - Deployed in private subnets
  - Security group allowing connections only from EC2 instances
  - Automated backups and maintenance

### 5. Security
- **Security Groups**:
  - ALB Security Group: Allows inbound HTTP/HTTPS from the internet
  - EC2 Security Group: Allows inbound traffic only from the ALB
  - RDS Security Group: Allows inbound database traffic only from EC2 instances
- **Network ACLs**: Additional layer of network security for subnets
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege access for EC2 instances and other services

### 6. Monitoring and Alerting
- **CloudWatch**:
  - Metrics collection for EC2, ALB, RDS
  - Alarms for high CPU, memory usage, and error rates
  - Dashboard for visualizing application performance
- **SNS**: Notification service for CloudWatch alarms
- **CloudTrail**: Logging of API calls for security analysis and compliance

### 7. Storage and Logging
- **S3 Buckets**:
  - ALB access logs
  - CloudWatch logs
  - Application artifacts and backups

## Scalability and High Availability Features
- Multiple Availability Zones for redundancy
- Auto Scaling to handle varying loads
- Load balancing to distribute traffic
- Multi-AZ RDS for database high availability
- Health checks to detect and replace unhealthy instances

## Cost Optimization
- Auto Scaling to match capacity with demand
- Reserved Instances for predictable workloads
- Spot Instances for non-critical, flexible workloads (optional)
- CloudWatch for monitoring and optimizing resource usage

## Security Best Practices
- Private subnets for application and database tiers
- Security groups with least privilege access
- IAM roles with minimum required permissions
- Encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Regular security patches via automated AMI updates

## Next Steps
This architecture will be implemented using Terraform to enable infrastructure as code, version control, and repeatable deployments.
